\section{Description of implementation}

\subsection{Representation}

To represent our system, we use an array of booleans with 2
dimensions: boolean[x][y]. When there is an egg, the boolean is true. The
temperature is an integer that starts at 2000 and decrease slowly at a rate of
95% per run until it reaches the minimal temperature of 1.

\subsection{Objective function}

To evaluate a solution, we first create a number that we consider as the
maximum number of eggs that we could possibly have in the box if we respect the
constraints. That doesn't mean that there is a solution in which we can put
that many eggs, but we are sure that we can't put more. This number is
\texttt{width_of_the_box \times limit_of_eggs_per_line}. For example for a box
with a size of 6*6 and a constraint of K=2, we consider that we can never place more than 6*2
= 12eggs.

Then, for a given solution, we count the \texttt{number of eggs in the box}, and
we retrieve the \texttt{number of violations}, which is the number of eggs that
are not respecting the contraints. For example if on a same line we have 4 eggs, with a
constraint K=2, we count 2 violations.

Finally, we retrieve this number to the first number we calculated. So for a
given solution X, we have a number calculated using the following formula:
\[
energy(X) = (size_of_the_box \times eggConstraint) - (violationCount() +
eggCount());
\]

The smaller this number is, the closer we are from the optimal solution. If we
reach 0, then we are sure that we have an optimal solution. If there is at
least one violation, then the solution is not considered as valid. But we can
still adopt it as one of our node in our algorithm.


Now that we have our objective function, let be X our current best solution and
X' our new candidate. If X' is better (energy(X') < energy(X)), then we select
it as our new best solution. But even if it's not the best, we have a
probability to accept it. To decide whether we adopt a solution X' or not, we
generate the probability of accepting it at a temperature T using the following
formula:
\[
 P = \exp(\frac{1000 \times (energy(X) - energy(X'))}{T})
\]

Then we generate a random double between 0 and 1, if it's less than the
probability P we just calculated, then we accept the solution X' even though
it's not better than our current solution.

\subsection{Neighbour generation}

To generate a neighbour from a current state, we check whether the solution is
valid (no violation of the constraints) or not. If it is valid, we add one egg
randomly in a free space. If it is not valid, then we move one random egg to a
random free space. Thus, the difference between a state and one of its neighbour
will always be one egg added or moved.

\section{Discussion: heuristic and objective functions}

Both of these types of functions give a value to a solution to evaluate how good
it seems, but the \texttt{heuristic functions} require to know our goal in order
to evaluate how appropriate a candidate seems to be. We know how an optimal solution
looks like. Whereas the \texttt{objective functions} evaluate a solution
without knowing of the optimal solution. They just give an estimation on
how good it seems, and then we need to compare two candidates in order to
choose which one seems to be best in order to reach our goal, but we can't know
if we have an optimal solution.
