\maketitle

\section{Description of implementation}

\subsection{Representation}
boolean[][] (true where the egg is)

\subsection{Objective functions}

see energy() and energyRelative()

\subsection{Neighbour generation}

if current solution is valid, add one egg to a free place

if it's invalid, find egg randomly and swith it with random free space

\section{Solutions found}

\section{Discussion}

heuristic - we know how a perfect solutions looks like

objective function - we dont know how perfect solution looks like, but we know
how to compare two solutions, so we can tell which one of two is better
